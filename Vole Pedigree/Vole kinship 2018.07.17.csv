ID row/column=,The leading 3 numbers identify the breeder pair (parents),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Off-diagonals = ,Kinship coefficients (from 0 to 1) for hypothetical offspring that would come from the corresponding breeder parents. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,These values in off-diagonals show how related two offspring that come from distinct breeder pairs are to each other. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"For example, a pup that comes from Breeder Pair 216 and a pup from Breeder Pair 205 would be 54.3% related (more than full siblings).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
