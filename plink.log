	--allow-no-sex

1625 (of 1625) markers to be included from [ ./Filtered/filter1_plink.map ]
Warning, found 95 individuals with ambiguous sex codes
Writing list of these individuals to [ plink.nosex ]
95 individuals read from [ ./Filtered/filter1_plink.ped ] 
0 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
0 cases, 0 controls and 95 missing
0 males, 0 females, and 95 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 1625 SNPs
95 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 1625 SNPs
After filtering, 0 cases, 0 controls and 95 missing
